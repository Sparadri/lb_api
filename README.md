## TO BE CHECKED / IMPROVED
* store website API key application.yml and manage accessibility
* sorting to be challenged


## TO DO

#### Ruby / Rails
* paginate > rails: kaminari or will_paginate?
* protect_from_forgery rationale and potential implementation (?)
* add statuses error > 400, 302
* add other models
* add picture uploader
* algolia search
* money-rails
* CRUD for collectioners

#### React / Redux
* friendly url name on redux
* add statuses error > 400, 302
* add picture uploader


## IN PROGRESS
* build react props


## THINKING
* should we add profession? sportif, blogger, etc..
* collection, when live, should update product status to live. and vice versa. product_live and collection_not_live relationship should not be possible.
* names should all be downcased when persisted in database and then upcased manually?
